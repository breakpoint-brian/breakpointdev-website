				<h2>pyrotechnics</h2>
				<p><em>noun</em></p>
				<ul id="blog-list">
					<li>the art of making or displaying fireworks</li>
				</ul>
        		<p>For many families the traditions of our Country's independence center around barbecues, parades, the proud display of our nation's colors, days boating on a lake or other body of water and copious amounts of alcohol along the way. While my family's traditions are not far from that standard, the past few years have introduced a new and exciting way to cap off the day's festivities. As you have guessed by now, it's a massive fireworks display.</p>
        		<p>It hasn't always been this way though. Nobody can say exactly when this trend started but we all agree it has been within the past three to four years. Prior to that point, the family would gather at my in-law's ranch in south Texas armed with a small arsenal of fireworks we picked up on the drive out there. The typical firework stash included sparklers, fountains, those crappy little tanks that are oddly fun to watch, the occasional bottle rocket if weather permitted and some roman candles. Looking back I'm not sure if it was the fireworks or watching everybody scramble away after lighting the fuse, while trying not to to fall or spill their beer in the process, that was so entertaining. My father in-law however, didn't find this as entertaining as the rest of us, and wanted more.</p>
        		<p>He came up with the idea that instead of popping off random fireworks at random intervals we needed to have an entire fireworks display. He took off to the nearest fireworks outlet/factory store and returned with a rather impressive spread of various firework delivery systems. There were the multi-shot boxes, mortar tubes, bottle rockets of all different kinds and of course a grab bag of smaller fireworks for the grandkids that put all of our previous offerings to shame.</p>
        		<p>That first night was the experiment. My wife's cousin and I were tasked with organizing an elaborate show for the rest of the family; how hard could that be? We resorted back to the tricks we had learned as young teenagers - tie as many fuses together and see what happens. This was great for the one off explosion but as the oohs and ahhs from the gathered crowd turned to "what's taking so long!?!?!" and other random one liners, we knew we had to step up our game. Silently working from his lawn chair with the best vantage point, my father in-law would occasionally yell to us to identify the name of the product we had just sent skywards. This scenario was then played out twice a year for the next three years.</p>
        		<p>Fast forward to this year's Fourth of July celebration and the nearly four hours of pre-show design, inventory review, preparation, and staging, we have made some incredible strides in our pyrotechnics prowess. My father in-law's inquisitive bellows have refined our selection of multi-shot boxes and large mortar selections to near perfect considering our method of operation. As technicians we have perfected our station setup and getting a feel for that internal timer of when it's time to abandon trying to light that second fuse in the mortar tube array.</p> 
        		<p>Even with all of our preparations things sometimes don't go as planned. We have had explosions go off right above our heads, tubes fall over, an unexpected shot hiss upwards from a multi-shot box as we were approaching it, small fires and numerous little burns from fuses or embers falling on our backs. Even though things don't always go as planned it is still a good time for spectators and technicians alike. As this tradition in our family has taken shape over the past few years I have learned that when it comes to fireworks, like many things in life, less is more and timing is everything.</p>

				<h2>"There's a fine line between fishing and standing on the shore like an idiot"</h2>
				<p>-Steven Wright</p>
				<p>Startled awake by the alarms of DEFCON 1 that were shouting from my phone I questioned what made me think that was a good idea just a few hours earlier when I was going to sleep. As I emerged from my room I found our guide busy at work loading up his vehicle in preparation for the day's journey. I mustered up the energy to throw my bag unceremoniously on top of a stack of neatly placed boxes infiltrating the back seating area of the truck and settled in to the passengers seat. A few minutes later we were off to our last stop for ice and breakfast tacos before making the trek down the beach.</p>
				<p>
				<div class="g2thumb">
					<img src="../images/truckthumb.png" alt="" style="position:relative;top:5px;left:6px;bottom:5px;">
					<p>The truck used to get down the beach</p>
				</div>
				<p>We were already twenty five miles down the beach when the first golden rays of the sun starting illuminating the sky. The truck was fairly silent at this point. We were either too tired to maintain a conversation or concentrating on holding ourselves steady against the merciless beating we were getting from the rough sand road. It wasn't long before the sun was in full view and the sea birds could be seen making their way out to sea on the hunt for their first meal of the day. With the sun the atmosphere in the car perked up and the next few hours was filled with laughter and anticipation for the fishing that was about to take place.</p>
				<p>After a grueling three and a half hour drive we had finally reached our destination. The beach was covered in seaweed but the water ahead of us was clear. The fishing was going to be good. We unpacked the essentials from the truck as quickly as possible and made a basic camp so we could focus on getting our lines in the water. It wasn't long before we had three lines cast far in the surf and another small tackle line hitting the deep pockets of water nearby. We continued this pattern for the majority of the afternoon, with some success, but not the hits we were hoping for. A small shark, a yellow jack and dozens of smaller bait fish from close in were all we were able to hook despite great fishing conditions. As our shadows began to creep out in to the surf our guide began the process of preparing his kayak and larger fishing rigs for the sharks that would be soon patrolling the waters.</p>
				<p>We watched from shore as the kayak our guide shoved off in was now just an orange spec against deep blue waters. The only thing telling us he was still heading out was the consistent ebb and flow grind of the reel letting out line as he kayaked the shark bait further and further. Once the line stopped letting out, the weight had hit the bottom, and that was our queue to flip the drag and tighten up the line from a platform on top of the truck. We repeated this process three more times and the rig was set for the night. Now all we had to do was wait for an alarm to go off and the fight to land a shark was on. So we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Slowly our band of four turned to three, then two. It was now twelve thirty at night and I was tired. I fell back to my tent cot and tried to get some rest.</p>
				<p>"Brian!, Brian!" was the next thing that I awoke to. I scrambled out of my tent and made my way in the darkness to the platform on top of the truck. As the guide is handing over control of the rig to me, he says,"I don't know what's on the end of that line, but it's big." My first pull upwards on the rod and I knew exactly what he meant. There was nothing but pure force and power on the end of that line. I was locked in a tug of war battle with something out there in the darkness. We would switch between this fish greedily taking yard after yard of line, pushing further out in to the gulf, to nothing happening at all. We would question whether or not the fish was still hooked because there was no detectable activity coming down the line. After ten to fifteen minutes, the gaps between runs to the open waters diminished and I was able to make significant progress in getting the fish in to shallower waters. I was anxious to meet the fish that put up such a great fight. As the guide pulled the fish the final ten yards in we quickly realized that this was no shark. What had grabbed on to the bait was a nearly eight foot long roughtail stingray.</p>
				<p>
				<div class="g2thumbleft">
					<img src="../images/baitthumb.png" alt="" style="position:relative;top:5px;left:6px;bottom:5px;">
					<p>The bait that was taken by the stingray</p>
				</div>
				<p>I had never (knowingly) been this close to wild stingray and to be standing on a beach in the middle of the night, hours from civilization, well let's say it was a little terrifying. I calmed my nerves enough to get close enough to take a few pictures, but still very weary of the lethal lance still attached to the tail of this fish. After the pictures I had a few moments to sit on the beach with this massive creature and take in the entire experience. Minutes later, it was time to release the stingray back to his home in the dark waters. I was left with a sense of amazement as I watched its wings begin to flap as the waves rolled over its body and within seconds this large creature had disappeared in to the murky surf. With our fishing lights turned out I sat watching the waves for the next hour wondering what else could be out there.</p>
				<p>The rest of the night was fairly uneventful and after a few hours of sleep I was awakened by the back and forth calls of the commuting sea birds. The sun was just barely peeking over the watery horizon as I slid out of my tent and greeted the day. The camp still showed signs of the previous nights battle. The baited lines we had so carefully set the night before had washed ashore and showed signs of coyotes or raccoons grabbing an early morning meal before disappearing behind the dunes for the day. As each person emerged from their tents the camp came alive once again we started the process of breaking it all down in preparation for another three plus hour trip back to civilization. Until one of the lines we had reset that morning started unraveling in to open waters. We had another fish.</p>
				<p>The first fish of the morning proved to be a fun challenge and a good size yellow jack was reeled in. With such little activity the day before, this was a great start to the day, even though we should have been more focused on getting off the beach. Shortly after the first fish was landed another line started singing and this time a little more fight was on the end of the line. Once again, based on the struggle that was playing out before us on the beach, we assumed that a shark had taken a smaller surf bait and we were in for a good one. The tug of war battle lasted five minutes before the fish finally gave in and allowed itself to be landed on shore. Once again, to our surprise, this was no shark but a decent sized stingray about four feet long. We were in good spirits now and all we had to do was finish packing up our actual fishing rigs and we would be on our way. Our guide disappeared behind the dunes for a minute and we watched the waves sparkle under the morning sun as they perpetually rolled in.</p>
				<p>Then came a loud pop and whine from the fishing platform on top of the truck. A reel was letting out line and if we had looked carefully I am sure we would have seen smoke coming off that reel. I raced to the platform flipped the drag and pulled up as hard as I could on the rod. I was immediately pulled forward against the railing by the unexpected surge in power heading out in to open water. Line was dumping fast and without the guide I was on my own in devising a strategy to get this fish turned around. From over my shoulder I hear "That's a big one!" and I knew my backup had arrived.</p>
				<p>After close to ten minutes I was beginning to question my ability to hang in the battle. The fight was becoming personal. It was a poker game with the loser being who showed weakness first. As I was about to hand over the line to rest, the line eased. I knew this was my chance and I started reeling in the slack line as fast as I could. As the yards and yards of line came in it was obvious the fish was swimming straight at the beach. With the line still fifty yards out our guide, sensing my fatigue, ran in to the waves to grab the line and provide assistance in the final landing. He was in about five feet of water when I see him jump back startled and the whip of a tail coming out of the water. Unintimidated, he grabs the line again and drags the huge stingray on to the beach. We sat there dumbfounded at what we were looking at. Was this the <em>same</em> stingray we had hooked the night before?</p>
				<p>Out came the measuring tape and after several measurements we concluded this was not the same ray from the night before. It was within a couple of inches of being the same length, but this one was much wider. We performed the same ritual as we had the night before and watched the fish glide gracefully under the incoming waves and back out to its home.</p> 
				<p>By this time all we had to do was pack up the rig and we were ready to go. On the ride back up the beach I replayed the past twenty four hours in my mind. We made the trip with the sole purpose of catching sharks. While it seemed the stingrays were more keen on our bait than the sharks, I couldn't help but think about a quote I had read in passing a few days prior while checking the surf conditions. It was a quote from Herbert Hoover and it read, "Fishing is much more than fish. It is the great occasion when we may return to the fine simplicity of our forefathers." Indeed. Man has been fishing for eons and even with today's technology, it all comes down to a string, a hook and the fisherman's will to outlast whatever is out there on the end of that line.<p>

				<h2>Come with me, let's get off the couch and outside. It's a gorgeous day.</h2>
				<p>These were my words to my two year old son as he sat virtually zombified by the iPad sitting in his lap. I had just been unexpectedly let go from my job and we were supposed to be utilizing this time getting away from the hectic pace of home life and capitalizing on our free time to enjoy the country. I patiently waited, hovering over the back of the couch, for him to acknowledge my words or even my presence. His eyes were fixed on the small screen in front of him as he sat like a statue and I knew it as time to intervene. In one quick motion I swept up the device, shut it down and placed it on a counter well out of his reach.</p>
				<p>The next few minutes was spent in a war of will as we searched for and eventually found his shoes and socks. Once outside, he proceeded to sit on the ground and pout like two year olds will do. He may be outside, but he wasn't going to be enjoying his time. My dad mind raced to find a way to grab his attention and interest. As I scanned the area around me my eyes fell on a golf cart that was parked nearby. My son has a weakness for anything with four wheels and a motor, so I hopped on the cart and asked if he wanted to go for a ride. He refused at first, but as I starting backing away he had a change of heart and frantically ran forward begging me to stop. Victory I thought to myself.</p>
				<p>As we cruised past the palm trees lining the quarter mile drive and turned down a dirt road leading to the back part of the property I remembered a clearing near a creek bed that the kids had played in over the summer. It was now November and I was sure the area would be well overgrown and hardly traversable, but what else did I have to do? I changed course and headed to the clearing. Inquisitive about the sudden change in course, my son began to question where I was taking him. I stopped at the trail entrance off the dirt road and surveyed the area. Tall plants were obscuring the way, but it was clear enough to make the trek and see what we could find down there. I unloaded my son and made the first few steps with him in tow. Still unsure of what we were doing, his tone became more intense as he grilled me on my intentions. "I don't know what is down here buddy, let's go take a look" was all that I could muster to satiate his unending questions.</p> 
				<p>As we broke the tree line and in to the clearing I was hit with an interesting feeling. There was a small weathered picnic table and a couple of toy tractors left behind that had been overgrown with weeds, almost like they were holding them in place, hoping someone would return for them. Had I not known these were my children's toys, I would have been left with a very eery feeling in the pit of my stomach. It was kind of surreal the way that som much had changed in a few months, but in many ways it was the same. Keeping my son close, we trudged through some bushes and made our way to the edge of the clearing, following the path of the flood waters that had recently passed through the area. With nothing too interesting in that direction, we turned about-face and started moving back towards the abandoned table and toys. What greeted me was nothing short of spectacular.</p>
				<p>I think my son also noticed it about the same time because we simply stood there with very much the same look on our face. His hand slowly fell out of my grasp and I was trying to remember if this amazing event was unfolding when we initially arrived at this spot. The entire clearing where we were was filled with hundred, if not thousands, of butterflies fluttering in the air and clinging to the dozens of bushes adorned with yellow flowers. Sensing my apprehension, my son asked me if I was alright, to which he received a simple yes. I was in awe and we made our way to the flowered plant nearest to us. We watched silently and the butterflies flew around us and moved from flower to flower getting what was probably a much needed meal. Overcome with excitement my son let out a squeal and I thought our time with the butterflies was over. Amazingly enough, they all stayed, seemingly unaware of our presence.</p>
				<p>I remember I had my phone in my pocket and quickly pulled up the camera app. I knew it was a futile attempt but I wanted to capture this moment of magic and bewilderment. I snapped a few pictures from afar and quickly brought them up on my phone. Would my camera adequately capture this moment? I was sadly disappointed to see the bright pops of orange against yellow was blurred according to the camera lens on my phone. All I could do was creep in and try to get at least a couple of good shots of a single butterfly to remember the moment by.</p>
				<p>Satisfied with my pictures and also realizing that it was now lunchtime I grabbed my son's hand and began walking back up the trail to the waiting golf cart. As his arm extended he yanked it back and exclaimed he didn't want to go. He wanted to stay and watch the butterflies some more. An hour earlier I was begging and bartering with him to get outside and enjoy the weather and now he was fighting me to stay outside. We eventually made our way back to the golf cart and to the kitchen table for lunch. The entire lunch was spent with him telling us stories varying in truth about the butterflies, how many there were, how one tried to bite him, and how his dad was so smart to be able to find them. We could have looked a butterflies all day on his iPad but his chance experience with these creatures had definitely gotten his attention.</p> 
				<p>We returned to the same spot a little later in the afternoon and much to our dismay the butterflies had moved on to wherever they were going. Struggling to comprehend why the butterflies would just disappear like that, my son asked me if they were magical. I looked down at the little face looking up at me with genuine curiosity as to the magical properties of butterflies. Realizing this was a moment that was created by mere chance I looked back and genuinely confirmed that "today, those butterflies are incredibly magical." Satisfied with his answer, he turned back to the golf cart and enthusiastically declared, "Daddy let's go. I'm hungry, can we get some ice cream?"</p>
